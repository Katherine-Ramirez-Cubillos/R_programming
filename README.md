This document contains the class notes for each of the four weeks that comprise the R-Programming course of the John Hopkins University, teaching by the professor Roger D.Peng.

## Week 1: Background, getting started, and Nuts & Bolts

This week covers the basic data types in R, and describe the funcitons for reading and writing data. 
- Entering Input
- Objects
- Attributes
- Creating vectors
- Mixing Objects
- Explicity Coercion
- Matrices
- Cbind-ing and rbind-ing
- List
- Factors
- Missing Values
- Data Frames
- Reading and Writing Data

## Week 2: Programming with R

This week covers key topics like control structures and functions, scoping rules and dates and times in R.  
- Control Structures

- For
- While loops
- Repeat
- Next, Return
- My First Function
- Functions
- Functions Arguments
- Arguments Matching
- Defining a Function
- Scoping Rules
- Lexical and Dynamic Scoping
- Dates and Times in R

## Week 3: Loop Functions and Debugging
This week covers loop functions and the debugging tools in R.

## Week 4: Simulation & Profiling
This week covers how to simulate data in R, it also covers the profiler in R, which is a key tool in helping optimize different programas. 
- The srt function
- Simulation
- Generating Random Numbers
- Generating Poisson data
